# FCN.tensorflow
Tensorflow implementation of [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211v1.pdf) (FCNs). 

There are two objectives of this project.
1. Mimic [original Caffe implementation](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org)
2. Use high-level API of Tensorflow

This project was forked from [shkkizh's implementation](https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow), but there was an upheaval for the project.\
Detail walkthroughs will be documented soon.
